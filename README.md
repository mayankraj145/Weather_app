# Weather App

The website is a fully responsive and functional weather app which accesses weather information through API.

I have used flexbox to create a responsive, centred card, and accessed APIs using JavaScript's 'fetch()'.

I have accessed weather from OpenWeatherMap API in JavaScript that displays the current weather for any location. The background image of the website also changes with respect to the search.

The website also displays the current time which is accessed through setInterval( ).

The website has also been hosted.

â€¢Used- HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
