# Weather App

Used HTML, CSS, JavaScript to create fully functional weather app using API.

Along with the weather the website will also show the current time.

I have accessed weather from OpenWeatherMap API in JavaScript that displays the current weather for any location.

The website is fully responsive and has also been hosted.
